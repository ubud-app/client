## üö® Warning

This software is still in a very early stage (early preview). Errors can occur at any time. Therefore ubud should currently not be used productively, but only for testing purposes.

## üßê What's this?

This is the repository that contains the [ubud](https://ubud.club) web interface. If you want to know more about ubud or want to try it out, look [here](https://github.com/ubud-app/server#readme).

## üê≥ Installation

The web client is already included in the docker image, so you probably woun't need to install it yourself.

## üí¨ Feedback & Help

For the early preview there are no issues possible, because I want to get the software to work well with it. However, questions and feedback can still be passed on. Either via Twitter [@ubudapp](https://twitter.com/ubudapp) or in our [Slack-Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/ubud-app/shared_invite/enQtNzAzNTU0MjM2MzUzLTY5MGRiZDE5ZDAyMDc3NDZkNGZlOGQxMTc2ZjA1NzEwZDk5ODc5YTc4MTg5N2VlYzY0ODViODZkNmQ0YTQ0MDk).

## ‚è± Roadmap

During the Early Preview you can find a very rough roadmap on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/ubud-app/projects/1).
